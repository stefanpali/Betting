<h2 id="bonus" class="hs">Who Has the Best Bonus Offer?</h2>
<p>If you are a beginner, the chances are you haven’t registered for an account on any betting site. As a result, you can look forward to bonuses for signing up, which may be the decisive criteria in choosing a particular provider.
It is vital that you take some time and check out welcome bonuses that betting sites offer. Most platforms are offering about €25 as a sign-up incentive, although you can find platforms that are more generous than that. These bonuses usually appear as free bets to use once or multiple times, but they also come in the form of deposit bonuses. Keep in mind that there will be certain conditions that needs to be meet before being able to withdraw the bonuses and your winnings, which is why you should read the terms of the offers carefully. Check out the bonus section for more details.</p>

<h2 id="mobile" class="hs">How Good Is the Mobile Compatibility?</h2>
<p>The appearance of mobile phones is one of the reasons why the popularity of sports betting has risen in the first place. The statistics show that the majority of players switched to portable devices in the last couple of years. It is precisely why most online sportsbooks have a specifically designed mobile app for their platform.
Although most apps are available for both Android and iOS, their quality significantly varies, which is why our team also focused on reviewing this software. We compared the ease of use and performance of each app and revealed that in our reviews. In case you want to know more on the topic, we suggest visiting our mobile app section.</p>

<hr class="separation-line" />

<h2 id="live" class="hs">How Are the In-Play Features?</h2>
<p>This is considered one of the latest trends in online betting as it took the world of online gambling to a whole new level. We have an entire section dedicated to in-play wagering. It is where we compare how the platforms show in this area. Our team focused on the available sports markets and the odds levels for live betting, including important in-play features such as live streaming and cashouts.
More than one sportsbook deserves to be commended in this area. The players consider this an important part of a betting platform, which is why the sportsbooks dedicate maximum attention to it. Please check out the pages we listed below to discover more about live betting!</p>

<hr class="separation-line" />

<h2 id="odds" class="hs">Which Betting Sites Has the Best Odds?</h2>
<p>Maybe you are only in it for the thrill of playing with real money, but it wouldn’t hurt to win. And while you are winning, you should find a place with the best odds to maximize the winning sum. The odds may largely vary from one sportsbook to another.
Some betting sites offer boosted odds for particular markets but somewhat neglect the others while there are sportsbooks that try to keep things balanced. The general rule of thumb is that you should look for platforms offering betting odds as close as possible to a hundred.
We tested some of the most popular sports markets and here are the results we came with.</p>

<p>Wondering how we came up with these results? It took a while to perform extensive testing as we analyzed a huge number of fixtures per market. We won’t dwell into details, but we calculated the odds levels in an effort to discover which platform keeps the most margin for themselves and which are most generous to the users. The closer the odds levels are to one hundred, the smaller the margin is for the sportsbook, meaning better odds levels for the players.
Please note that the numbers are as accurate portrayal as that is possible. Naturally, the result may be different if you only analyze a portion of fixtures, but we believe that our sample was big enough to portray things the way they are in reality.</p>

<hr class="separation-line" />

<h2 id="payment" class="hs">Which Payment Methods Are Available?</h2>
<p>If you only have a single payment option at your disposal, this will be crucial criteria for you. However, the truth is that the top betting sites support all the major deposit options, so it might not make a big difference after all. A huge majority of the platforms accepts debit and credit cards, such as Visa and Mastercard.
Most of them also accept Skrill, Neteller, and other e-wallets, as well as classic banking transfers, which usually take a bit more time for processing. Although platforms are pretty well-covered when it comes to payment options, some of them offer a particularly large number of deposit methods, which might make others look bad, but the decision at the end of the day is entirely up to you.</p>

<h2 id="support" class="hs">How Good Is the Customer Support?</h2>
<p>Do you think this is not an important area to consider? If that is the case, you may want to rethink and imagine this scenario – you might have a problem with a welcome bonus or a question about how the website works. In those situations, you may check the FAQ section, but fail to find an answer and the only thing to do is to contact the customer support.
You need the staff to respond as quickly as possible so that you can continue playing. The good news is that most betting platforms have live chat support available around the clock these days.</p>

<p>Now, all providers claim that their customer support can be contacted 24/7 and the players can expect a quick answer. Unfortunately, the situation is somewhat different in reality. It is nice to see that a platform offers live chat, e-mail, and telephone support, but you need information on how well they handle the workload.
Huge betting sites means a lot of work for customer agents, which is why the quality of their service matters as much as the support options available. We tested these support services and you will find the results of our research in the above table and in our comprehensive reviews.</p>

<hr class="separation-line" />

<h2 id="security" class="hs">How Secure Are the Betting Sites?</h2>
<p>There are two things you want to be safe while playing at an online betting site – your personal information and your funds. We are living in dangerous cyber times and hackers are trying to exploit every potential weakness, which is why the best providers apply the highest security measures possible.
The first thing top betting sites adhere to are standards of gambling authorities. Many of them have acquired a license from the Gambling Commission of the United Kingdom, but you can find that many of them also have permits from Malta Gaming Authority, which are important for doing business in European countries. Many providers also obtain licenses from Alderney, Antigua & Barbuda, and Gibraltar gaming authorities.</p>
